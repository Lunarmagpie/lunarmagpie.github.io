title: Introduting Aporia, a Window Manager for X11 and Wayland

Last year, I started development of my window manager, [Aporia](https://github.com/Lunarmagpie/aporia). 
As someone who loves the command line, I wanted to be able to log in without a graphical interface but none of the
options at the time had the visuals that I wanted. Although I love the progrom [Ly](https://github.com/fairyglade/ly)
written by FairyGlade, the visuals got boring to me after a while.

Aporia is desinged for one feature: displaying ascii art in the background when you log in. The early 2000s aestetic is
absolutely perfect, and we should have never left it. 


# Aporia 0.1.0

Today, i'm launching Aporia 0.1.0.
