title: Don't Be An "X" Developer

In the developer world we feel a need to classify ourselves into a certain type of developer.
For example: Frontend Developer, Backend Developer, Compiler Developer, or god forbid React Developer.
Since I started programming I always felt the need to put myself into one of these groups. The only problem
was they didn't make sense to me. Any program worth writing felt impossible to fit into just one concept.

We we put our selves into groups, we limit what we are able to do. If you are a "developer" you
are telling yourself you can do anything you want, but if you call yourself a "backend developer" you've told
yourself you are only capable of that one tiny thing.

After programming for years, I realized I am too ambitious to just be in one group.
My favorite and most difficult programs are from all different categorizes of software development.
The joy of solving a problem doesn't come from what category it is, but what the end product is.
If you think what you are writing is awesome, I promise you will enjoy writing it. Even if
you thought you were a frontend hater, it might turn out you don't hate the frontend. You probably
just never wrote frontend software you thought was cool.

A good developer isn't sticking to one small thing.
Good developers are able to find a cool idea and execute it no matter what.
Be a master of everything. Or at least learn a little bit.
