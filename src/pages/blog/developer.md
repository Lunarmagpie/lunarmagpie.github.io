title: Don't Be An "X" Developer

In the developer world we feel a need to classify ourselves into a certain type of developer.
For example: Frontend Developer, Backend Developer, Compiler Developer, or god forbid React Developer.
Since I started programming I always felt the need to put myself into one of these. What do you do
when you are a developer with no skills and you need a group to put yourself in? You pick Backend
Developer because everyone says is really difficult and tricky.

It turns out after a few years of programming, I couldn't fit myself into single type of development
category. Frontend Development is too confusing, Backend Development includes so many things I'm not even
sure what a backend dev does, Compiler Developers know what a monad is, and React Developer is self explanitory.

There seems to be a disconnect between how developers categorize themselves and what I enjoy. How is it
possible I either hate what the category does or am not knowleddgeable to do it, yet I still enjoy programming?
